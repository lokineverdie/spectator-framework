# Spectator Framework - Product Description

## Introduction

This document defines the product vision for Spectator Framework - a comprehensive system for creating agent templates through spec-driven development. The framework empowers developers to build technology-agnostic agent specifications that can be implemented across any platform, with core rules, templates, and guidelines that support systematic agent development.

## Glossary

- **Spectator_Framework**: The foundational system for creating agent templates through spec-driven development
- **Agent_Template**: A reusable specification pattern for building system-agnostic agents
- **Spec_Driven_Development**: Methodology where comprehensive specifications drive all development activities
- **System_Agnostic**: Technology-neutral approach that enables implementation across any platform
- **Template_Library**: Collection of reusable agent specification templates and patterns
- **Framework_Guidelines**: Core principles and standards that govern agent template creation

## Product Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a framework user, I want comprehensive agent template creation guidelines, so that I can build system-agnostic agent specifications efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Spectator_Framework SHALL provide standardized agent specification templates
2. THE Spectator_Framework SHALL establish technology-neutral design principles
3. THE Spectator_Framework SHALL define documentation standards for agent specifications
4. THE Spectator_Framework SHALL provide validation guidelines for specification quality
5. THE Spectator_Framework SHALL offer template libraries for common agent patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a specification developer, I want standardized project organization, so that I can structure agent specifications consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Spectator_Framework SHALL define directory structure for agent specifications
2. THE Spectator_Framework SHALL specify file naming conventions for all specification artifacts
3. THE Spectator_Framework SHALL provide templates for specification documentation
4. THE Spectator_Framework SHALL establish version control patterns for agent templates
5. THE Spectator_Framework SHALL define artifact formats for specifications, diagrams, and data models

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a specification developer, I want to follow spec-driven development methodology, so that I can create comprehensive agent specifications before implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Spec_Driven_Development SHALL support specification-first development approach
2. THE Spec_Driven_Development SHALL define specification validation principles
3. WHEN an agent specification is created, THE Spectator_Framework SHALL provide quality guidelines
4. THE Spec_Driven_Development SHALL specify implementation readiness criteria for specifications
5. THE Spec_Driven_Development SHALL support iterative specification refinement and validation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an implementer, I want system-agnostic agent specifications, so that I can choose appropriate technologies and platforms during implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Spectator_Framework SHALL avoid technology-specific implementation details in specifications
2. THE Spectator_Framework SHALL provide multiple implementation pathway guidance
3. THE Spectator_Framework SHALL define platform-neutral agent interface specifications
4. THE Spectator_Framework SHALL support various technology stack choices
5. WHERE technology examples are provided, THE Spectator_Framework SHALL offer multiple alternatives

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a framework user, I want comprehensive template libraries, so that I can quickly create agent specifications using proven patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Spectator_Framework SHALL provide template libraries for common agent patterns
2. THE Spectator_Framework SHALL specify agent specification composition guidelines
3. THE Spectator_Framework SHALL offer template customization and extension guidance
4. THE Spectator_Framework SHALL define template versioning and maintenance approaches
5. THE Spectator_Framework SHALL support both standalone agent templates and integrated system patterns
